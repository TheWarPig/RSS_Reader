–plms — Specifies how the images will be sampled. There is a paper about it, if you want to check out the math.
–n_iter — specifies the number of iterations you want to generate for each prompt. 5 is a decent number to see what kind of results you’re getting.
–n_samples — specifies the number of samples that will be generated. The default is 3, but most computers do not have enough VRAM to support that. Stick with 1 unless you have a specific reason to change it.
Of course, Stable Diffusion has a ton of different arguments that you can implement to tweak your results. Run python scripts/txt2img.py --help to get an exhaustive list of arguments that you can use.
